# Jacob's Farming Contests

[This website](https://jacobs.strassburger.dev/) can be used to get an overview about the future farming contests.
The data for this website has to be collected manually. Because of this, after the new year event, there might be no contests showing up. Please be patient and wait until I update them.

If you want to use the data from this website for your own project, you can use the [https://jacobs.strassburger.dev/api/jacobcontests](https://jacobs.strassburger.dev/api/jacobcontests) endpoint. If you're building something public-facing (like a website, bot, app, etc.), I ask you to include a link or note somewhere in your project crediting [jacobs.strassburger.dev](https://jacobs.strassburger.dev/) as your data source.

If you have any questions or suggestions, you can dm me on Discord (@Kartoffelchipss).
